####  Full documentation can be viewed @ https://www.overleaf.com/read/phkkpsjnkyjy .
### manorz (03/02/20): function.py include a code for gradients maps generation.
####  Those gradients maps intend to be our 'labels' for the model.
####  The results are gathered in a directory called 'depth_gradients'. 
####  In order to generate, just prompt: python ./functions.py
####  In order to see example, go through the attached jupyter notebook. 
####  Next task is to wrap tohse labels, rgb images & depth maps as a pytorch dataloder.
